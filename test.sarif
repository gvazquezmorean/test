This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.\n\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe `log4j-core` package is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The `createConnectionSource()` method in the `DataSourceConnectionSource` class does not ensure if a JDBC Appender configured with a `DataSource` has JNDI's Java protocol enabled before allowing JDBC connections using the `DataSource`. An attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can exploit this behavior by constructing a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI to achieve RCE in an affected application.\n\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI.\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nWe recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.\n\n*Mitigating controls from project advisory:*\n\n```\n* Upgrade to Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).\n\n* In prior releases confirm that if the JDBC Appender is being used it is not configured to use any protocol other than Java.\n\n* Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n* Also note that Apache Log4j is the only Logging Services subproject affected by this vulnerability. Other projects like Log4net and Log4cxx are not impacted by this.\n```\n\nReference: [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\nNote: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path.

This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1.\n\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe `log4j-core` package is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to Uncontrolled Recursion. The methods and classes listed below allow for recursive evaluation of lookups with user-supplied inputs. Remote attackers with control over `Thread Context Map` data can supply specially-crafted inputs containing a recursive lookup. This will result in the process terminating when the logging configuration uses a non-default `Pattern Layout` with a `Context Lookup`, leading to a DoS condition.\n\n*Vulnerable File(s) and Function(s)*:\n\norg/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/StrSubstitutor.class\n* replace()\n* substitute()\n\norg/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/AbstractConfiguration.class\n* initialize()\n* doConfigure()\n\n*Note:* The Attack Complexity of this vulnerability is still being discussed with the maintainers. We have deemed it High at this time due to the specific configuration necessary for the vulnerability to be exploited. \n\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`)\n\nReference: [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nWe recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.\n\nMitigating controls from the project advisory:\n```\nUpgrade to Log4j 2.3.1 (for Java 6), 2.12.3 (for Java 7), or 2.17.0 (for Java 8 and later).\n\nAlternatively, this infinite recursion issue can be mitigated in configuration:\n\n* In PatternLayout in the logging configuration, replace Context Lookups like ${ctx:loginId} or $${ctx:loginId} with Thread Context Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC).\n* Otherwise, in the configuration, remove references to Context Lookups like ${ctx:loginId} or $${ctx:loginId} where they originate from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input.\n```\n\nReference: [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\nNote: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path.

This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.\n\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe `log4j-core` package is vulnerable to the Use of an Externally-Controlled Format String. The `format()` method in the `MessagePatternConverter` and `MessagePatternConverter$LookupMessagePatternConverter` classes allow `JNDI LDAP` lookups to be made to remote hosts by default while logging application events. If the data retrieved is used to control the input data utilized in `Thread Context Maps` or `Context Lookups`, an attacker with control over a logged value may craft a malicious JNDI lookup string that causes `log4j` to crash. This may result in undefined behavior in applications utilizing `log4j-core`, and can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n__Update:__ This vulnerability may also lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the application server's configuration and has been updated to reflect that. Reference: [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n\nNote: This vulnerability is a follow-up to [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) to address the DoS attack vector and an RCE attack vector under certain configurations.\n\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component in a manner that allows Context maps to be controlled by the user, or when `log4j` configurations allow hosts to be reached using `jndi` lookups.\n\nReference: [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nWe recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.\n\nNote: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path.

The `getRememberedPrincipals()` and `decrypt()` methods in the `AbstractRememberMeManager` class fail to clear decrypted data from memory. A local attacker can leverage this behavior to potentially obtain sensitive information from memory, such as user credentials, by influencing a core dump or similar memory dumping errors.\n\n\n**Detection**\n\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component.\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nWe recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.\n\nNote: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path. In this instance, we recommend contacting the maintainers who included the vulnerable package. Alternatively, we recommend investigating alternative components or a potential mitigating control.\n\n\n**Advisories**\n- https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/254\n- https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/36\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-349\n\n\nCheck the [vulnerability details page](https://sonatype.sonatype.app/platform/assets/index.html#/vulnerabilities/sonatype-2016-0702) for the latest details about this issue and possible recommendations."
